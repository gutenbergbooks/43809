BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND THE FIRST BALLOONS.

<p class="sep2">
The recent bi-centenary of Franklin’s birth, which coincided
with the revival of interest in balloons, makes this a
timely topic, especially since Franklin’s descriptions of the
first balloon ascensions are almost unknown and do not
appear among his philosophical papers. The five letters
which I have the honor to present were written to Sir
Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Society of London, in
1783, when Franklin was Minister to the Court of France
and, with the collateral documents, they give perhaps the
most complete and accurate account of the beginning of
aerial navigation, enlivened with the humor and speculation
characteristic of the writer. It is certainly remarkable
that Franklin, in the midst of diplomatic and social duties,
could have found time to investigate personally this new
invention of which he at once appreciated the possibilities.
</p>

<p>
The documents which I publish are copies of Franklin’s
letters, made on thin paper in a copying press (probably
the rotary machine invented by Franklin), and all but one
bear his signature in ink. They have corrections in the
author’s hand-writing and, except for a few words, are
quite legible. They were purchased by me from Dodd,
Mead &amp; Co., in December, 1905, and previously had belonged
to G. M. Williamson, of Grandview-on-the-Hudson, to
whom they had come from Vienna. None of the letters
appear in Sparks’ edition of Franklin’s Works, and while
all but one are included in the collections compiled by
Bigelow and Smyth, there are numerous inaccuracies, some
of which will be specified hereafter.  Drafts of three of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4'>[4]</a></span>
letters are deposited in the University of Pennsylvania,
but the existence of one letter and the whereabouts of
another were unknown to the late Mr. Smyth, the editor
of the last and most complete edition of Franklin’s Works,<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
who made careful search for the original documents.
Although the American owners of these copies did not allow
them to be transcribed, Mr. Smyth states that he printed one
letter from my copy, and he noted how the other copies differed
from the drafts in the University of Pennsylvania. In
general it may be said that, whereas Bigelow gives the text
without paragraphs, capital letters or the old spelling,<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
Smyth follows the originals more closely. In view of the
historic and scientific interest of these letters, they are now
printed exactly according to the press-copies. The letter
dated November 30, appears never to have been printed
and whereas Smyth reproduced the letter of November 21
from the University of Pennsylvania draft, this or another
draft (or possibly this copy) was in the possession of the
French aeronaut, Gaston Tissandier, about 1887.<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3' href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>

<h2>
(THE FIRST HYDROGEN BALLOON.)
</h2>

<p class="r4">
<span class='smcap'>Passy</span>, Aug. 30, 1783.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class='smcap'>Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>
On Wednesday, the 27<sup>th</sup> Instant the new aerostatic Experiment,
invented by Mess<sup>rs</sup>. Montgolfier, of Annonay, was
repeated by M. Charles, Professor of experimental Philosophy
at Paris.
</p>

<p>
A hollow Globe 12 feet Diameter was formed of what
is called in England Oiled Silk, here <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Taffetas gommé</i>,
the Silk being impregnated with a Solution of Gum elastic
in Lintseed Oil, as is said. The Parts were sewed together
while wet with the Gum, and some of it was afterwards
passed over the Seams, to render it as tight as possible.
</p>

<p>
It was afterwards filled with the inflammable Air that
is produced by pouring Oil of Vitriol upon Filings of Iron,
when it was found to have a tendency upwards so strong as to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5'>[5]</a></span>
be capable of lifting a Weight of 39 Pounds, exclusive of
its own Weight which was 25 lbs. and the Weight of the
Air contain’d.
</p>

<p>
It was brought early in the morning to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champ de
Mars</i>, a Field in which Reviews are sometimes made,
lying between the Military School and the River. There
it was held down by a Cord till 5 in the afternoon, when it
was to be let loose. Care was taken before the Hour to
replace what Portion had been lost, of the inflammable
Air, or of its Force, by injecting more.
</p>

<p>
It is supposed that not less than 50,000 People were
assembled to see the Experiment. The Champ de Mars
being surrounded by Multitudes, and vast Numbers on the
opposite Side of the River.
</p>

<p>
At 5 aClock Notice was given to the Spectators by the
Firing of two Cannon, that the Cord was about to be cut.
And presently the Globe was seen to rise, and that as fast
as a Body of 12 feet Diameter, with a force only of 39
Pounds, could be suppos’d to move the resisting Air out
of its Way. There was some Wind, but not very strong.
A little Rain had wet it, so that it shone, and made an
agreeable Appearance. It diminished in Apparent Magnitude
as it rose, till it enter’d the Clouds, when it seem’d
to me scarce bigger than an Orange, and soon after became
invisible, the Clouds concealing it.
</p>

<p>
The Multitude separated, all well satisfied and delighted
with the Success of the Experiment, and amusing one
another with discourses of the various uses it may possibly
be apply’d to, among which many were very extravagant.
But possibly it may pave the Way to some Discoveries
in Natural Philosophy of which at present we have no
Conception.
</p>

<p>
A Note secur’d from the Weather had been affix’d to the
Globe, signifying the Time &amp; Place of its Departure, and
praying those who might happen to find it, to send an account
of its State to certain Persons at Paris. No News was
heard of it till the next Day, when Information was receiv’d,
that it fell a little after 6 aClock, at Gonesse, a Place about
4 Leagues Distance, and that it was rent open, and some say
had Ice in it. It is suppos’d to have burst by the Elasticity
of the contain’d Air when no longer compress’d by so
heavy an Atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6'>[6]</a></span>
One of 38 feet Diameter is preparing by M<sup>r</sup>. Montgolfier
himself, at the Expence of the Academy, which is to go
up in a few Days. I am told it is constructed of Linen &amp;
Paper, and is to be filled with a different Air, not yet made
Public, but cheaper than that produc’d by the Oil of Vitriol,
of which 200 Paris Pints were consum’d in filling the other.
</p>

<p>
It is said that for some Days after its being filled, the Ball
was found to lose an eighth Part of its Force of Levity
in 24 Hours; Whether this was from Imperfection in the
Tightness of the Ball, or a Change in the Nature of the
Air, Experiments may easily discover.
</p>

<p>
I thought it my Duty, Sir, to send an early Account of
this extraordinary Fact, to the Society which does me the
honour to reckon me among its Members; and I will endeavour
to make it more perfect, as I receive farther Information.
</p>


<div class="sig">
<span class="i10">With great Respect, I am, Sir,</span>
<span class="i30">Your most obedient</span>
<span class="i40">and most humble Servant</span>
<span class="i60">B. FRANKLIN</span>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
<span class='smcap'>Sir Joseph Banks</span>, Bar<sup>t</sup>.
</p>

<p>
P. S. Since writing the above, I am favour’d with your
kind Letter of the 25<sup>th</sup>. I am much obliged to you for the
Care you have taken to forward the Transactions, as well
as to the Council for so readily ordering them on Application.
Please to accept and present my Thanks.
</p>

<p>
I just now learn, that some observers say, the Ball was
150 Seconds in rising, from the Cutting of the Cord till hid
in the Clouds; that its height was then about 500 Toises,
but, being moved out of the Perpendicular by the Wind,
it had made a Slant so as to form a Triangle, whose Base
on the Earth was about 200 Toises. It is said the Country
People who saw it fall were frightned, conceiv’d from its
bounding a little, when it touched the Ground, that there
was some living Animal in it, and attack’d it with Stones
and Knives, so that it was much mangled; but it is now
brought to Town and will be repaired.
</p>

<p>
The great one of M. Montgolfier, is to go up, as is said,
from Versailles, in about 8 or 10 Days; It is not a Globe
but of a different Form, more convenient for penetrating
the Air. It contains 50,000 cubic Feet, and is supposed
to have Force of Levity equal to 1500 pounds weight.
A Philosopher here, M. Pilatre du Rozier has seriously
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7'>[7]</a></span>
apply’d to the Academy for leave to go up with it, in order
to make some Experiments. He was complimented on his
Zeal and Courage for the Promotion of Science, but advis’d
to wait till the management of these Balls was made by
Experience more certain &amp; safe. They say the filling of
it in M. Montgolfier’s Way will not cost more than half a
Crown. One is talk’d of to be 110 feet Diameter. Several
Gentlemen have ordered small ones to be made for their
Amusement. One has ordered four of 15 feet Diameter
each; I know not with what Purpose; But such is the
present Enthusiasm for promoting and improving this
Discovery, that probably we shall soon make considerable
Progress in the art of constructing and using the
Machines.
</p>

<p>
Among the Pleasanteries Conversation produces on this
Subject, some suppose Flying to be now invented, and
that since Men may be supported in the Air, nothing is
wanted but some light handy Instruments to give and direct
Motion. Some think Progressive Motion on the Earth
may be advanc’d by it, and that a Running Footman or
a Horse slung and suspended under such a Globe so as to
have no more of Weight pressing the Earth with their Feet,
than Perhaps 8 or 10 Pounds, might with a fair
Wind run in a straight Line across Countries as fast as
that Wind, and over Hedges, Ditches &amp; even Waters. It
has been even fancied that in time People will keep such
Globes anchored in the Air, to which by Pullies they may
draw up Game to be preserved in the Cool &amp; Water to be
frozen when Ice is wanted. And that to get Money, it
will be contrived to give People an extensive View of the
Country, by running them up in an Elbow Chair a Mile
high for a Guinea &amp;c. &amp;c.

(A HOT AIR BALLOON CARRYING ANIMALS.)
</h2>


<p class="r4">
<span class='smcap'>Passy</span>, Oct. 8, 1783.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class='smcap'>Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>
The Publick were promised a printed particular Account
of the Rise &amp; Progress of the Balloon Invention, to be
published about the End of last month. I waited for it
to send it to you, expecting it would be more satisfactory
than anything I could write; but it does not appear. We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8'>[8]</a></span>
have only at present the enclosed Pamphlet, which does
not answer the expectation given us. I send you with it
some prints. That of the Balloon raised at Versailles is
said to be an exact representation. I was not present,
but am told it was filled in about ten minutes by means
of burning Straw. Some say water was thrown into the
flame, others that it was Spirits of Sal Volatile. It was
supposed to have risen about 200 Toises: But did not continue
long at that height, was carried horizontally by the
Wind, and descended gently as the Air within grew
cooler. So vast a Bulk when it began to rise so majestically
in the Air struck the spectators with surprise
and Admiration. The Basket contained a sheep, a
duck, and a Cock, who, except the Cock, received no hurt
by the fall.
</p>

<p>
The Duke de Crillon made a feast last week in the Bois
de Boulogne, just by my habitation, on occasion of the
Birth of two Spanish Princes; after the Fireworks we had
a Balloon of about 5 feet Diameter filled with permanent
inflammable Air. It was dismissed about One aClock in
the Morning. It carried under it a large Lanthorn with
inscriptions on its sides. The Night was quite calm and
clear, so that it went right up. The appearance of the light
diminished gradually till it appeared no bigger than one
of the Stars, and in about twenty minutes I lost sight of
it entirely. It fell the next Day on the other side of the
same Wood near the Village Boulogne, about half after
twelve, having been suspended in the Air eleven hours
and a half. It lodged in a tree, and was torn in getting it
down; so that it cannot be ascertained whether it burst
when above, or not, tho’ that is supposed. Smaller Repetitions
of the Experiment are making every day in all
quarters. Some of the larger Balloons that have been up
are preparing to be sent up again in a few Days; but I do
not hear of any material improvements yet made either
in the mechanical or Chemical parts of the Operation.
Most is expected from the new one undertaken upon subscription
by Messieurs Charles and Robert, who are Men of
Science and mechanic Dexterity. It is to carry up a
Man. I send you enclosed the Proposals, which it is said
are already subscribed to by a considerable number and
likely to be carried into execution.  If I am well at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9'>[9]</a></span>
Time, I purpose to be present, being a subscriber myself,
and shall send you an exact Account of Particulars.

<h2>
(THE FIRST AERIAL VOYAGE BY MAN.)
</h2>


<p class="r4">
<span class='smcap'>Passy</span>, Nov<sup>r</sup> 21<sup>st</sup>, 1783
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class='smcap'>Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>
I received your friendly Letter of the 7<sup>th</sup> Inst. I am
glad my Letters respecting the Aerostatic Experiment
were not unacceptable. But as more perfect Accounts of
the Construction and Management of that Machine have
been and will be published before your Transactions, and
from which Extracts may be made that will be more particular
and therefore more satisfactory, I think it best not
to print those Letters. I say this in answer to your Question;
for I did not indeed write them with a view of their being
inserted. M<sup>r</sup>. Faujas de St. Fond acquainted me yesterday
that a Book on the Subject which has been long expected,
will be publish’d in a few Days, and I shall send you one of
them. Enclosed is a Copy of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Procès verbal</i> taken of
the Experiment made yesterday in the Garden of the
Queen’s Palace la Muette where the Dauphin now resides
which being near my House I was present. This Paper
was drawn up hastily, and may in some Places appear to
you obscure; therefore I shall add a few explanatory Observations.
</p>

<p>
This Balloon was larger than that which went up from
Versailles and carried the Sheep, &amp;c. Its bottom was open,
and in the middle of the Opening was fixed a kind of Basket
Grate in which Faggots and Sheaves of Straw were burnt.
The Air rarified in passing thro’ this Flame rose in the
Balloon, swell’d out its sides, and fill’d it.
</p>

<p>
The Persons who were plac’d in the Gallery made of
Wicker, and attached to the Outside near the Bottom,
had each of them a Port thro’ which they could pass Sheaves
of Straw into the Grate to keep up the Flame, &amp; thereby
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>[10]</a></span>
keep the Balloon full. When it went over our Heads, we
could see the Fire which was very considerable. As the
Flame slackens, the rarified Air cools and condenses, the
Bulk of the Balloon diminishes and it begins to descend.
If those in the Gallery see it likely to descend in an improper
Place, they can by throwing on more Straw, &amp; renewing the
Flame, make it rise again, and the Wind carries it farther.
</p>

<p>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Machine poussée par le Vent s’est dirigée sur une des
Allées du Jardin.</i> That is against the Trees of one of the
Walks. The Gallery hitched among the top Boughs of those
Trees which had been cut and were stiff while the Body of
the Balloon lean’d beyond and seemed likely to overset. I
was then in great Pain for the Men, thinking them in danger
of being thrown out, or burnt for I expected that the Balloon
being no longer upright the Flame would have laid
hold of the inside that leaned over it. But by means of
some Cords that were still attach’d to it, it was soon brought
upright again, made to descend, &amp; carried back to its place.
It was however much damaged.
</p>

<p>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Planant sur l’Horizon.</i> When they were as high as they
chose to be, they made less Flame and suffered the Machine
to drive Horizontally with the Wind, of which however
they felt very little, as they went with it, and as fast. They
say they had a charming View of Paris &amp; its Environs,
the Course of the River, &amp;c but that they were once lost, not
knowing what Part they were over, till they saw the Dome
of the Invalids, which rectified their Ideas. Probably
while they were employed in keeping up the Fire, the Machine
might turn, and by that means they were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">desorientés</i> as
the French call it.
</p>

<p>
There was a vast Concourse of Gentry in the Garden,
who had great Pleasure in seeing the Adventurers go off
so chearfully, &amp; applauded them by clapping &amp;c. but there
was at the same time a good deal of Anxiety for their Safety.
Multitudes in Paris saw the Balloon passing; but did not
know there were Men with it, it being then so high that
they could not see them.
</p>

<p>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Développant du Gaz.</i> That is, in plain English, <i>burning
more straw</i>; for tho’ there is a little Mystery made, concerning
the kind of Air with which the Balloon is filled, I conceive
it to be nothing more than hot Smoke or common Air
rarify’d, tho’ in this I may be mistaken.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11'>[11]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aiant encor dans leur Galerie les deux tiers de leur Approvisionement.</i>
That is their Provision of Straw; of which
they carried up a great Quantity. It was well that in the
hurry of so hazardous an Experiment, the Flame did not
happen by any accidental Mismanagement to lay hold
of this Straw; tho’ each had a Bucket of Water by him, by
Way of Precaution.
</p>

<p>
One of these courageous Philosophers, the Marquis
d’Arlandes, did me the honour to call upon me in the Evening
after the Experiment, with Mr. Montgolfier the very
ingenious Inventor. I was happy to see him safe. He
informed me that they lit gently without the least Shock,
and the Balloon was very little damaged.
</p>

<p>
This Method of filling the Balloon with hot Air is cheap
and expeditious, and it is supposed may be sufficient for
certain purposes, such as elevating an Engineer to take a
View of an Enemy’s Army, Works, &amp;c. conveying Intelligence
into, or out of a besieged Town, giving Signals to
distant Places, or the like.
</p>

<p>
The other Method of filling a Balloon with permanently
elastic inflammable Air, and then closing it is a tedious
Operation, and very expensive; Yet we are to have one of
that kind sent up in a few Days. It is a Globe of 26 feet
diameter. The Gores that compose it are red and white
Silk, so that it makes a beautiful appearance. A very handsome
triumphal Car will be suspended to it, in which Mess<sup>rs</sup>.
Robert, two Brothers, very ingenious Men, who have
made it in concert with M<sup>r</sup>. Charles propose to go up. There
is room in this Car for a little Table to be placed between
them, on which they can write and keep their Journal,
that is take Notes of every thing they observe, the State
of their Thermometer, Barometer, Hygrometer, &amp;c which
they will have more Leisure to do than the others,
having no fire to take Care of. They say they have
a contrivance which will enable them to descend at
Pleasure. I know not what it is. But the Expence of
this Machine, Filling included, will exceed, it is said,
10,000 Livres.
</p>

<p>
This Balloon of only 26 feet diameter being filled with
Air ten times lighter than common Air, will carry up a
greater Weight than the other, which tho’ vastly bigger
was filled with an Air that could scarcely be more than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12'>[12]</a></span>
twice as light. Thus the great Bulk of one of these
Machines, with the short duration of its Power, &amp; the
great Expence of filling the other will prevent the Inventions
being of so much Use, as some may expect, till
Chemistry can invent a cheaper light Air producible with
more Expedition.
</p>

<p>
But the Emulation between the two Parties running
high, the Improvement in the Construction and Management
of the Balloons has already made a rapid Progress;
and one cannot say how far it may go. A
few Months since the Idea of Witches riding thro’ the
Air upon a Broomstick, and that of Philosophers upon
a Bag of Smoke, would have appeared equally impossible
and ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
These Machines must always be subject to be driven by
the Winds. Perhaps Mechanic Art may find easy means
to give them progressive Motion in a Calm, and to slant
them a little in the Wind.
</p>

<p>
I am sorry this Experiment is totally neglected in England
where mechanic Genius is so strong. I wish I could see
the same Emulation between the two Nations as I see
between the two Parties here. Your Philosophy seems
to be too bashful. In this Country we are not so much
afraid of being laught at. If we do a foolish thing, we
are the first to laugh at it ourselves, and are almost as much
pleased with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon Mot</i> or a good <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chanson</i>, that ridicules well
the Disappointment of a Project, as we might have been
with its Success. It does not seem to me a good reason to
decline prosecuting a new Experiment which apparently
increases the Power of Man over Matter, till we can see to
what Use that Power may be applied. When we have
learnt to manage it, we may hope some time or other to
find Uses for it, as Men have done for Magnetism and
Electricity of which the first Experiments were mere
Matters of Amusement.
</p>

<p>
This Experience is by no means a trifling one. It may be
attended with important Consequences that no one can foresee.
We should not suffer Pride to prevent our progress in
Science. Beings of a Rank and Nature far superior to ours
have not disdained to amuse themselves with making and
launching Balloons, otherwise we should never have enjoyed
the Light of those glorious objects that rule our Day &amp; Night,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13'>[13]</a></span>
nor have had the Pleasure of riding round the Sun ourselves
upon the Balloon we now inhabit.

I did myself the honour of writing to you the Beginning
of last Week, and I sent you by the Courier, M. Faujas’s
Book upon the Balloons, which I hope you have receiv’d.
I did hope to have given you to day an Account of Mr.
Charles’s grand Balloon, which was to have gone up yesterday;
but the filling it with inflammable Air having taken
more time than had been calculated, it is deferr’d till to-morrow.
I send you herewith a Paper in which you will
see what was proposed by Mess<sup>rs</sup> Robert who constructed
the Machine; and some other Papers relative to the same
Subject, the last of which is curious, as containing the Journal
of the first Aerial Voyage performed by Man.—I purpose
being present to-morrow at the Experiment, and shall
give you an Acc<sup>t</sup> of it by the Wednesday’s Post.

<h2>
(THE SECOND AERIAL VOYAGE BY MAN.)
</h2>

<p class="r4">
<span class='smcap'>Passy</span>, Dec. 1, 1783.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class='smcap'>Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>
In mine of yesterday, I promis’d to give you an Account
of Mess<sup>rs</sup>. Charles &amp; Robert’s Experiment, which was to
have been made at this Day, and at which I intended to
be present. Being a little indispos’d, &amp; the Air cool, and
the Ground damp, I declin’d going into the Garden of the
Tuilleries where the Balloon was plac’d, not knowing how
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14'>[14]</a></span>
long I might be oblig’d to wait there before it was ready
to depart; and chose to stay in my Carriage near the Statue
of Louis XV. from whence I could well see it rise, &amp; have
an extensive View of the Region of Air thro’ which, as the
Wind sat, it was likely to pass. The Morning was foggy,
but about one aClock, the Air became tolerably clear, to
the great Satisfaction of the Spectators, who were infinite,
Notice having been given of the intended Experiment
several Days before in the Papers, so that all Paris was out,
either about the Tuilleries, on the Quays &amp; Bridges, in
the Fields, the Streets, at the Windows, or on the Tops of
Houses, besides the Inhabitants of all the Towns &amp; Villages
of the Environs. Never before was a philosophical Experiment
so magnificently attended. Some Guns were fired to give
Notice, that the Departure of the great Balloon was near,
and a small one was discharg’d which went to an amazing
Height, there being but little Wind to make it deviate from
its perpendicular Course, and at length the Sight of it was
lost. Means were used, I am told, to prevent the great
Balloon’s rising so high as might indanger its Bursting.
Several Bags of Sand were taken on board before the Cord
that held it down was cut, and the whole Weight being
then too much to be lifted, such a Quantity was discharg’d
as to permit its Rising slowly. Thus it would sooner arrive
at that Region where it would be in Equilibrio with the surrounding
Air, and by discharging more Sand afterwards,
it might go higher if desired. Between One &amp; Two aClock,
all Eyes were gratified with seeing it rise majestically from
among the Trees, and ascend gradually above the Buildings,
a most beautiful Spectacle! When it was about 200 feet
high, the brave Adventurers held out and wav’d a little
white Pennant, on both Sides their Car, to salute the Spectators,
who return’d loud Claps of Applause. The Wind
was very little, so that the Object, tho’ moving to the Northward,
continued long in View; and it was a great while before
the admiring People began to disperse. The Persons
embark’d were M<sup>r</sup>. Charles, Professor of Experimental
Philosophy, &amp; a zealous Promoter of that Science; and one
of the Messieurs Robert, the very ingenious Constructors of
the Machine. When it arrived at its height, which I suppose
might be 3 or 400 Toises, it appeared to have only
horizontal Motion.  I had a Pocket Glass, with which I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15'>[15]</a></span>
follow’d it, till I lost Sight, first of the Men, then of the
Car, and when I last saw the Balloon, it appear’d no bigger
than a Walnut. I write this at 7 in the Evening. What
became of them is not yet known here. I hope they
descended by Day-light, so as to see &amp; avoid falling
among Trees or on Houses, and that the Experiment was
completed without any mischievous Accident which the
Novelty of it &amp; the want of Experience might well occasion.
I am the more anxious for the Event, because I am not
well inform’d of the Means provided for letting themselves
gently down, and the Loss of these very ingenious Men
would not only be a Discouragement to the Progress of
the Art, but be a sensible Loss to Science and Society.
</p>

<p>
I shall inclose one of the Tickets of Admission, on which
the Globe was represented, as originally intended, but is
altered by the Pen to show its real State when it went off.
When the Tickets were engraved, the Car was to have been
hung to the Neck of the Globe, as represented by a little
Drawing I have made in the Corner A. I suppose it may
have been an Apprehension of Danger in straining too
much the Balloon or tearing the Silk, that induc’d the
Constructors to throw a Net over it, fix’d to a Hoop which
went round its Middle, and to hang the Car to that Hoop,
as you see in Fig. B.
</p>

<p>
Tuesday Morning, Dec. 2. I am reliev’d from my
Anxiety, by hearing that the Adventurers descended well
near l’Isle Adam, before Sunset. This Place is near 7
Leagues from Paris. Had the Wind blown fresh, they
might have gone much farther.
</p>

<p>
If I receive any farther Particulars of Importance I
shall communicate them hereafter.

<p class="noindent">
P. S. Tuesday Evening.
</p>

<p>
Since writing the above, I have receiv’d the printed
Paper &amp; the Manuscript, containing some Particulars of
the Experiment, which I enclose.—I hear farther, that the
Travellers had perfect Command of their Carriage, descending
as they pleas’d by letting some of the inflammable Air
escape, and rising again by discharging some Sand; that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16'>[16]</a></span>
they descended over a Field so low as to talk with Labourers
in passing and mounted again to pass a Hill. The little
Balloon falling at Vincennes, shows that mounting higher
it met with a Current of Air in a contrary Direction: An
Observation that may be of use to future aerial Voyagers.

<h2>
NOTES CONCERNING THE LETTERS.
</h2>

<p class="fsmaller">
<i>Letter of August 30.</i> The hand-writing is in a more flowing style
than the subsequent letters. Bigelow omits paragraph ten beginning
“It is said.” Both Bigelow and Smyth give another paragraph in the
Postscript, beyond the signature “B. F.” in my copy; also a note dated
Sept. 2<sup>d</sup>, which contains calculations in French relating to the balloon.
Smyth says that these additions are not in the University of Pennsylvania
draft but that they occur in this press-copy, which is obviously a mistake.
In paragraph two of the Postscript “mov’d out,” in Smyth, should read
“being moved out,” and in the last line but one “upon” should read
“up in.”
</p>

<p class="fsmaller">
<i>Letter of October 8.</i> In the eighth line after the word “Balloon”
Smyth inserts “lately.” Part of the valedictory and the signature are
omitted by Bigelow and Smyth, but the former gives an “Extract of
the Proposals” for the balloon of which I have no copy.
</p>

<p class="fsmaller">
<i>Letter of November 21.</i> This should be dated Nov. 22, since the ascension
of d’Arlandes and de Rozier which, according to the letter, took
place the previous day is known to have been on the 21st. The orthography
of the French words in Bigelow and Smyth does not always
agree with the copy. In paragraph three, for “Post,” in Smyth, read
“Port;” in paragraph six for “Adventures,” in Smyth, read “Adventurers;”
in paragraph thirteen for “By the emulation,” in Smyth,
read “But the Emulation;” in paragraph fifteen for the phrase, in Smyth
and Bigelow, beginning, “I wish I could see the same emulation,”
correct to end, “between the two Nations as I see between the two
Parties here;” in paragraph sixteen, in both Bigelow and Smyth, for
“Experiment,” read “Experience;” and for the unintelligible phrase in
both Bigelow and Smyth, “Beings of a frank and [sic] nature,” read
“Beings of a Rank and Nature.” Minor discrepancies between this and
the other press-copies and the letters as printed by Bigelow and
Smyth also occur. The signature is in pencil in this copy. A “P. S.
Nov. 25th” is not in the press-copy, contrary to Smyth’s statement,
but I have a press-copy of the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Procès-Verbal</i>, therein referred
to, in Franklin’s handwriting with his name and eight others affixed
as witnesses. Neither Bigelow nor Smyth print this document, which
was first reproduced in the book mentioned by Franklin in the first
paragraph of his letter, viz: “Description des Expériences de la Machine
Aérostatique par M. Faujas de Saint-Fond, Paris, 1783.” Since Franklin’s
copy of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Procès-Verbal</i> differs only in his spelling the word
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang-froid</i>” instead of “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sens-froid</i>,” I do not print it. However,
other changes were introduced in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Procès-Verbal</i> when reprinted in
the second volume of M. Faujas’ work, published in 1784.   The plate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18'>[18]</a></span>
forming the frontispiece to this volume shows the balloon as seen from
Mr. Franklin’s terrace at Passy.
</p>

<p class="fsmaller">
<i>Letter of November 30.</i> This has never been published so far as I know.
“The Journal of the first Aerial Voyage,” here mentioned, was written
by the Marquis d’Arlandes to M. Faujas de Saint-Fond on Nov. 28th
and first printed in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Paris</cite> but was republished by Faujas
de Saint-Fond in his second volume.
</p>

<p class="fsmaller">
<i>Letter of December 1.</i> Smyth states that he reproduced this letter
from my press-copy but he omits the capital letters and the contractions
in spelling, as well as the references “A” and “B,” which are given
by Bigelow with the remark that the drawings were not found. “The
Manuscript, containing some Particulars of the Experiment, which I
enclose,” mentioned in the Postscript, is a two-page account in French,
in Franklin’s handwriting, by an eye-witness of the voyage, M. le
Chevalier de Cubière. As this interesting document has never been
published, to my knowledge, I have given it here <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literatim</i> from my
press-copy.
